FILTER CALIBRATION PROCEDURE
============================
Moog Minimoog Model D - Ladder Filter (904A Type)

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED
------------------
- Oscilloscope (dual trace preferred)
- Function generator (sine, 1 Hz - 20 kHz)
- Digital multimeter
- Frequency counter
- 1V/octave CV source

PRE-CALIBRATION CHECKS
----------------------
1. Verify all filter capacitors replaced (see capacitor log)
2. Check transistor matching on ladder (Q11-Q14)
3. Measure supply voltages: +10V, -10V (±0.5V tolerance)

CUTOFF FREQUENCY CALIBRATION
----------------------------
1. Set CUTOFF knob to maximum
2. Set EMPHASIS to minimum
3. Input 1 kHz sine wave at LINE IN
4. Adjust R41 until output is -3dB at 10 kHz

RESONANCE (EMPHASIS) CALIBRATION  
---------------------------------
1. Set CUTOFF to 1 kHz
2. Increase EMPHASIS to maximum
3. Verify self-oscillation occurs
4. Adjust R45 for clean sine at resonance
5. Check: no distortion, stable amplitude

KEYBOARD TRACKING CALIBRATION
-----------------------------
1. Connect 1V/octave CV source to FILTER CV
2. Set KEYBOARD CONTROL to maximum
3. Verify filter tracks keyboard ±5 cents across 4 octaves
4. Adjust R43 for tracking accuracy

FINAL VERIFICATION
------------------
[ ] Cutoff sweeps full range smoothly
[ ] Resonance self-oscillates cleanly
[ ] No audio bleed when filter fully closed
[✓] Keyboard tracking verified - JW 2025-12-01
