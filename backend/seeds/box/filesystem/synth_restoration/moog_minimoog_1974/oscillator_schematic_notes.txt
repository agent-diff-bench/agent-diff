OSCILLATOR CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
===========================
Moog Minimoog Model D - Oscillator Section
Reference: Service Manual Rev 2.1 (1975)

OSCILLATOR 1 (VCO-1)
--------------------
Core IC: CA3046 transistor array
Temperature compensation: Tempco resistor R17
CV input: 1V/octave standard
Range: 0.1 Hz to 20 kHz (with range switch)

Key Components:
- Q1, Q2: Matched pair in CA3046
- R15: 100K scale trimmer
- R16: 10K high-frequency tracking
- C21, C22: Timing capacitors (critical - use film type)

KNOWN ISSUES (Serial 10000-11000)
---------------------------------
1. Oscillator drift after warmup - typically stabilizes after 15 minutes
2. High-frequency tracking error above 5 kHz
3. Sawtooth core bleedthrough on triangle output

CALIBRATION PROCEDURE
---------------------
1. Allow 30-minute warmup
2. Set OSC 1 to A-440 reference
3. Adjust R15 for 1V/octave tracking
4. Check at C2 (523.25 Hz) and C5 (1046.50 Hz)
5. Fine-tune R16 for high-frequency accuracy

RESTORATION STATUS
------------------
[ ] Temperature compensation verified
[ ] Scale trim completed  
[ ] Drift test (30 min warmup) - PENDING
[ ] All octaves tracking within 5 cents
