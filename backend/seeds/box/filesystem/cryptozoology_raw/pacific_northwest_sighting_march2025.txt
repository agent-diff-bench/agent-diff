CRYPTOZOOLOGY FIELD REPORT
==========================

Expedition: Sasquatch Survey NW-7
Location: Olympic Peninsula, Washington State
Date: March 14-18, 2025
Lead Researcher: Dr. Helena Voss

SUMMARY
-------
During routine trail camera maintenance near the Hoh River valley, our team 
encountered anomalous tracks measuring 18 inches in length with a stride 
of approximately 5.2 feet. Follow-up investigation on March 16th yielded 
direct visual contact at 0547 hours.

OBSERVATION DETAILS
-------------------
Weather: Overcast, light fog, 42°F
Visibility: Approximately 80 meters
Duration of sighting: 47 seconds

A large bipedal figure was observed moving through old-growth forest at 
coordinates 47.8623° N, 123.9341° W. Estimated height: 7.5-8 feet. 
Coloration appeared dark brown to black. Subject displayed fluid, 
purposeful movement before disappearing into dense undergrowth.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED
------------------
- Plaster casts of 3 distinct footprints (catalog #NW7-2025-001 through 003)
- Hair samples from bark scraping (submitted for DNA analysis)
- Photographic evidence attached as Exhibit B (4 frames, low resolution due to fog)

The photographic evidence, while not conclusive, represents the clearest 
imagery obtained by our organization in the Pacific Northwest region since 2019.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
Recommend immediate follow-up expedition within 30 days while conditions 
remain favorable. Request additional funding for thermal imaging equipment.
