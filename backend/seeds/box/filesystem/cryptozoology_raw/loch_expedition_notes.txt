CRYPTOZOOLOGY FIELD REPORT
==========================

Expedition: Scottish Highlands Monitoring
Location: Loch Ness, Inverness-shire, Scotland
Date: February 2-9, 2025
Lead Researcher: Dr. Ian McAllister

SUMMARY
-------
Week-long monitoring operation utilizing sonar array deployment and 
surface observation protocols. Primary objective: verification of 
reported anomalies from civilian witnesses in January 2025.

EQUIPMENT DEPLOYED
------------------
- Lowrance HDS-16 Live sonar units (x4)
- Underwater ROV with 4K camera system
- Surface thermal imaging station
- Hydrophone array for acoustic monitoring

OBSERVATIONS
------------
February 4, 2025, 14:23 GMT:
Sonar anomaly detected at depth of 78 meters. Large return signature 
approximately 12 meters in length. Object displayed non-ballistic 
movement pattern inconsistent with known fish species or debris.

February 6, 2025, 03:17 GMT:
Secondary sonar contact at 45 meters depth. Duration: 3 minutes 
22 seconds before signal loss. Estimated velocity: 8-10 knots.

EVIDENCE STATUS
---------------
Despite multiple sonar contacts, no photographic evidence obtained 
during this expedition. ROV deployment on February 5th was aborted 
due to equipment malfunction (propulsion failure at 35m depth).

Water turbidity significantly higher than anticipated, limiting 
visual range to approximately 2-3 meters even with auxiliary lighting.

CONCLUSIONS
-----------
Sonar data suggests presence of large aquatic fauna not catalogued 
in official records. However, without visual confirmation, findings 
remain inconclusive. Recommend summer expedition when visibility 
conditions improve.
