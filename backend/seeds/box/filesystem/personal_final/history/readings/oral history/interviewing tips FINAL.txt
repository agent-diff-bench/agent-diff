CONDUCTING ORAL HISTORY INTERVIEWS: A PRACTICAL GUIDE
======================================================

WHAT IS ORAL HISTORY?
---------------------
Oral history is a method of gathering, preserving, and interpreting 
the voices and memories of people who participated in historical 
events. Unlike traditional documentary research, oral history creates 
new primary sources through structured interviews.


BEFORE THE INTERVIEW
--------------------

Research Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Study the historical context thoroughly
  - Learn about your narrator's background
  - Identify key events, dates, and people to explore
  - Prepare open-ended questions that invite storytelling
  - Avoid questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no"

Technical Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Test all recording equipment beforehand
  - Bring backup batteries and storage media
  - Choose a quiet location with minimal background noise
  - Position the microphone properly (lapel mics work best)
  - Do a brief test recording and play it back

Ethical Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Obtain informed consent in writing
  - Explain how the interview will be used and stored
  - Clarify whether the narrator can review transcripts
  - Discuss any topics that may be off-limits
  - Be clear about rights to the recording


DURING THE INTERVIEW
--------------------

Building Rapport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first few minutes set the tone. Begin with:
  - Comfortable small talk
  - Easy biographical questions (where they grew up, family)
  - Let the narrator settle into the role of storyteller

Effective Questioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DO:
  * Ask one question at a time
  * Use follow-up questions: "Can you tell me more about that?"
  * Allow silences—narrators often fill them with valuable details
  * Show genuine interest through body language
  * Let the narrator lead when they have momentum

DON'T:
  * Interrupt or finish their sentences
  * Express judgment about their experiences
  * Challenge their memory directly
  * Rush to the next question
  * Share your own opinions excessively

Handling Difficult Moments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oral history often touches on painful memories. If emotional:
  - Offer to pause the recording
  - Provide tissues and water
  - Ask if they want to continue
  - Never pressure them to discuss traumatic events


AFTER THE INTERVIEW
-------------------

Processing
~~~~~~~~~~
  1. LABEL EVERYTHING - Date, narrator name, location, interviewer
  2. CREATE A LOG - Note timestamps for key topics
  3. TRANSCRIBE CAREFULLY - Include pauses, laughter, emphasis
  4. SEND FOR REVIEW - Allow narrator to clarify or redact

Preservation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Store recordings in multiple formats and locations
  - Create metadata describing the collection
  - Consider donation to an archive
  - Maintain contact information for the narrator


COMMON PITFALLS
---------------
  - Over-preparing questions leads to rigid interviews
  - Ignoring tangents misses unexpected valuable material
  - Forgetting context—always record date, location, circumstances
  - Technical failures—the most important interview is lost


CONCLUSION
----------
Oral history is both a research method and a human encounter. The 
best interviewers combine scholarly rigor with genuine empathy, 
creating spaces where people feel safe to share their stories.
