ARCHIVES AND POWER: WHAT GETS PRESERVED
========================================

THE ARCHIVE AS CONSTRUCTION
---------------------------
Archives are not passive repositories of the past. They are active 
constructions shaped by power, resources, and ideology. What survives 
into the historical record reflects who had the ability to create 
documents, who decided to preserve them, and who maintains access.


MECHANISMS OF SILENCE
---------------------

Creation
~~~~~~~~
Not all events generate records. Illiterate populations leave fewer 
written traces. Informal economies operate without receipts. Marginalized 
communities often lack the resources or incentive to document their 
experiences.

What typically gets recorded:
  - Official transactions (taxes, courts, property)
  - Elite correspondence and memoirs
  - Institutional proceedings
  - Published materials

What often doesn't:
  - Daily life of ordinary people
  - Underground or resistance activities
  - Oral traditions and folk knowledge
  - Experiences of the colonized, enslaved, and dispossessed

Assembly
~~~~~~~~
Even when records are created, someone must decide to save them. Archives 
reflect institutional priorities. Government records are preserved because 
governments fund archives. Corporate records survive when businesses see 
value in them.

Questions to ask:
  * Who founded this archive?
  * What was their collecting mandate?
  * What did they consider historically significant?

Access
~~~~~~
Preserved records aren't always accessible. Classification systems, 
language barriers, physical deterioration, and institutional gatekeeping 
all limit who can use what. Digital archives expand access but create new 
divides between those with and without technology.


CASE STUDIES
------------

The Enslaved in the Archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enslaved people appear in historical records primarily as property—
inventories, bills of sale, plantation ledgers. Their inner lives, 
relationships, and resistance are rarely documented in their own words. 
Historians must read "against the grain," extracting meaning from records 
created by enslavers.

Colonial Archives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Imperial powers generated massive documentation of colonized peoples—but 
from the colonizer's perspective. Administrative records categorized, 
counted, and controlled. Indigenous knowledge systems were often dismissed 
as primitive or simply ignored.

Women's History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For centuries, women's experiences were considered private and unremarkable. 
Domestic labor, childrearing, and community networks left fewer traces than 
male-dominated public life.


READING AGAINST THE GRAIN
-------------------------
When direct documentation is absent, historians develop creative strategies:

  1. TRACES IN OFFICIAL RECORDS - Court cases, police reports, and 
     administrative files reveal marginalized voices, however mediated
  2. MATERIAL CULTURE - Objects, buildings, and landscapes preserve 
     evidence that paper records miss
  3. ORAL HISTORY - Living memory supplements written sources
  4. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS - Patterns across similar contexts suggest 
     what specific archives omit


THE ARCHIVIST'S ROLE
--------------------
Contemporary archivists increasingly recognize their power to shape 
historical memory. Best practices now include:
  - Community archives—supporting marginalized groups
  - Descriptive justice—revising outdated finding aids
  - Transparency—documenting gaps and biases
  - Proactive collecting—seeking diverse materials


CONCLUSION
----------
Every historical argument rests on surviving evidence. Understanding how 
archives are constructed—and what they exclude—is essential to responsible 
scholarship. The silences in the archive are not absences of history; they 
are traces of power.
