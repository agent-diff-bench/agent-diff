ARGENTINA'S 2001 ECONOMIC CRISIS - STUDY NOTES
==============================================

BACKGROUND
----------
After a decade of neoliberal reforms under President Carlos Menem (1989-1999), 
Argentina experienced a severe economic collapse in December 2001. The crisis 
combined financial meltdown, political upheaval, and social unrest.

KEY FACTORS LEADING TO CRISIS
-----------------------------

Economic Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Convertibility Law (1991): Pegged peso 1:1 to US dollar
  - Privatization of state enterprises
  - Trade liberalization
  - Accumulating foreign debt

Structural Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Overvalued currency made exports uncompetitive
  - Growing unemployment throughout the 1990s
  - Provincial government deficits
  - Dependence on foreign capital inflows

External Shocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - 1997 Asian financial crisis
  - 1998 Russian default
  - 1999 Brazilian devaluation
  - Rising US dollar (to which peso was pegged)


THE CRISIS UNFOLDS (2001)
-------------------------

Timeline
~~~~~~~~
  * March: Economy Minister Cavallo returns, tries austerity
  * July: "Zero deficit" law cuts public salaries and pensions
  * November: Bank run begins
  * December 1: "Corralito" freezes bank accounts
  * December 19-20: Widespread protests, looting, repression

  * January 2002: Peso devalued, ending convertibility


THE DECEMBER UPRISING
---------------------

Events of December 19-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Spontaneous protests erupted across the country. In Buenos Aires, thousands 
gathered at Plaza de Mayo. Police repression resulted in approximately 39 
deaths nationwide. The iconic image of middle-class Argentines banging pots 
and pans (cacerolazo) became a symbol of the uprising.

Slogan: "Que se vayan todos!" (They all must go!)
  - Rejection of entire political class
  - Not just economic grievance but crisis of representation


SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES
-------------------
  - Unemployment peaked at over 20%
  - Poverty rate reached 57% in 2002
  - Middle class devastation
  - Emigration wave (especially to Spain and Italy)
  - Rise of barter networks and alternative economies
  - Neighborhood assemblies (asambleas barriales)
  - Worker-recuperated enterprises (fábricas recuperadas)


POLITICAL AFTERMATH
-------------------
Five presidents in two weeks (December 2001 - January 2002):
  1. Fernando de la Rúa (resigned)
  2. Ramón Puerta (interim, 2 days)
  3. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá (1 week, declared default)
  4. Eduardo Camaño (interim, 2 days)
  5. Eduardo Duhalde (until 2003 elections)


RECOVERY AND LESSONS
--------------------
  - Nestor Kirchner elected 2003
  - Debt restructuring (2005, 2010)
  - Commodity boom aided recovery
  - Rejection of IMF-style austerity
  - Return of state intervention in economy
