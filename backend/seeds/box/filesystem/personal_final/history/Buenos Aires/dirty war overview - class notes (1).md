# The Argentine Dirty War (1976-1983): An Overview

## Historical Context

The period from 1976 to 1983 in Argentina is commonly referred to as the "Dirty War" (Guerra Sucia), during which a military junta ruled the country following a coup against President Isabel Perón. This era represents one of the most traumatic chapters in Argentine history.

## The Military Junta

The coup of March 24, 1976 brought to power a junta led initially by General Jorge Rafael Videla. The military government called its program the "Process of National Reorganization" (Proceso de Reorganización Nacional), claiming to restore order and combat leftist insurgency.

## State Terror

The regime implemented a systematic campaign of state terrorism characterized by:

- **Forced disappearances** - Thousands of people were abducted by security forces
- **Clandestine detention centers** - Hundreds of secret facilities operated throughout the country
- **Torture** - Systematic use of brutal interrogation methods
- **Extrajudicial executions** - Many detainees were killed without trial
- **Theft of children** - Babies born to detained pregnant women were given to military families

## The Disappeared

The term "desaparecidos" (disappeared) refers to victims who were abducted and never seen again. Estimates vary:

- Official government figures: approximately 9,000
- Human rights organizations: up to 30,000
- Victims included students, workers, journalists, intellectuals, and anyone suspected of opposition

## Resistance and Memory

### Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo

Beginning in 1977, mothers of the disappeared began gathering in Buenos Aires' central plaza, wearing white headscarves and carrying photos of their missing children. Their weekly marches became a powerful symbol of resistance and continue to this day.

### Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo

This organization focused specifically on locating children stolen during the dictatorship. Using DNA testing and investigative work, they have identified over 130 grandchildren as of recent years.

## Transition to Democracy

The military's disastrous 1982 Falklands/Malvinas War against Britain accelerated the regime's collapse. Democratic elections in 1983 brought Raúl Alfonsín to power.

## Justice and Memory

### The CONADEP Report

The National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) documented the regime's crimes in its 1984 report "Nunca Más" (Never Again), which became a foundational document for transitional justice worldwide.

### Trials and Amnesty

- 1985: Junta leaders convicted in historic trials
- 1986-87: "Full Stop" and "Due Obedience" laws limited prosecutions
- 1989-90: Presidential pardons freed convicted officers
- 2005: Supreme Court declared amnesty laws unconstitutional
- Ongoing: Trials continue to this day

## Significance for Memory Studies

The Argentine case is frequently studied for:

1. How societies reckon with traumatic pasts
2. The role of civil society in demanding accountability
3. Tensions between peace and justice in transitions
4. The evolution of transitional justice mechanisms
5. Intergenerational transmission of trauma and memory
